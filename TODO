TODO:
- middleware & view changes to pass referrer_url along
- add a route that can be hit to confirm authentication; it either redirects to a referrer_url with a refreshed token, or to a login page
- figure out which devise modules to use

User flows:
- arrive by address bar, unauthenticated
- get logged in (maybe by creating a new account)
- get redirected to a "you're logged in!" page

- arrive by redirect, unauthenticated
- get logged in (maybe by creating a new account)
- get redirected to your original referrer_url

- arrive by redirect, authenticated
- get redirected to your original referrer_url
